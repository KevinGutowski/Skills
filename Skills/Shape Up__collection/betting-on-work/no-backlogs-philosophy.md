# The No Backlogs Philosophy

## Why Backlogs Are a Problem

Backlogs are a big weight we don't need to carry. Dozens and eventually hundreds of tasks pile up that we all know we'll never have time for.

**The psychological burden:** The growing pile gives us a feeling like we're always behind even though we're not. Just because somebody thought some idea was important a quarter ago doesn't mean we need to keep looking at it again and again.

**The time cost:** Backlogs are big time wasters. The time spent constantly reviewing, grooming, and organizing old ideas prevents everyone from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter right now.

## What We Do Instead

Before each six-week cycle, we hold a **betting table** where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle. At the betting table, they look at pitches from the last six weeks—or any pitches that somebody purposefully revived and lobbied for again.

Nothing else is on the table:
- No giant list of ideas to review
- No time spent grooming a backlog of old ideas
- Just a few well-shaped, risk-reduced options

With just a few options and a six-week cycle, these meetings are infrequent, short, and intensely productive.

## The Decision Flow

| Decision | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Bet on it** | It goes into the next cycle to build |
| **Don't bet** | We let it go. Nothing to track or hold on to. |

What if the pitch was great, but the timing wasn't right? Anyone who wants to advocate for it again simply tracks it independently and lobbies for it six weeks later.

## Decentralized Lists

We don't have to choose between a burdensome backlog and not remembering anything from the past.

Everyone can still track ideas independently without a central backlog:

| Who | What They Track | How |
|-----|----------------|-----|
| Support | Common requests and issues | Their own list |
| Product | Ideas to shape in future cycles | Their own notes |
| Programmers | Bugs they'd like to fix | Their own list |

None of these lists are direct inputs to the betting process. They're personal memory aids, not obligations.

## Cross-Pollinating Ideas

Regular but infrequent one-on-ones between departments help share ideas:
- Support tells Product about top issues they're seeing
- Product might track one of those as a potential project to shape
- In a future one-on-one, Support can lobby again for something that hasn't gotten attention

This approach:
- Spreads out the responsibility for prioritizing
- Makes prioritization manageable
- Keeps conversations fresh and timely

## Important Ideas Come Back

It's easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.

**Really important ideas will come back to you.** When's the last time you forgot a really great, inspiring idea?

If it's a bug customers run into from time to time:
- It'll come back to your attention when a customer complains again
- If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn't really a problem
- If you keep hearing about it, you'll be motivated to shape a solution

## The Freedom of Letting Go

| With Backlogs | Without Backlogs |
|---------------|------------------|
| Always behind | Fresh start each cycle |
| Grooming meetings | Productive betting table |
| Guilt about old items | Focus on what matters now |
| Obligation to old ideas | Freedom to choose best options |

Letting go of the backlog isn't losing anything. It's gaining the freedom to focus on what's actually important right now.
