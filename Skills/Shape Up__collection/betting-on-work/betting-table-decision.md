# The Betting Table

## What It Is

The betting table is where stakeholders decide what to build in the next cycle. It happens during cool-down, before each six-week cycle begins.

At the betting table:
- A few shaped pitches are on the table
- No backlogs to review
- No giant lists to groom
- Just a focused discussion about a few options

## Who Attends

The betting table is small by design:
- CEO or product leader
- CTO or technical leader
- Senior product person

That's it. No big meetings. No committee decisions. A few people who can make real commitments.

## The Inputs

| Input | What It Provides |
|-------|------------------|
| **Shaped pitches** | Options to bet on |
| **Cycle review** | What happened last cycle |
| **Team availability** | Who can work on what |
| **Strategic priorities** | What matters now for the business |

## Five Questions to Ask

For each pitch, work through these questions:

### 1. Does the problem matter NOW?

| Good Signs | Red Flags |
|------------|-----------|
| Customers actively asking | Vague "nice to have" |
| Blocking revenue or growth | Solving imagined problems |
| Competitive necessity | "Might be useful someday" |
| High support volume on this issue | Low priority for actual users |

### 2. Is the appetite right?

| Right Appetite | Wrong Appetite |
|----------------|----------------|
| Worth the time we'd spend | Overpaying for the value |
| Couldn't realistically do it in less | Could be smaller with smart cuts |
| Matches the strategic importance | Gold-plating a minor feature |

### 3. Is the solution solved?

| Solved | Not Solved |
|--------|------------|
| Clear sketches (breadboard or fat marker) | "The team will figure it out" |
| Rabbit holes addressed | Open questions about core approach |
| Technical viability confirmed | Hand-waving about implementation |
| De-risked through shaping | Unknowns swept under the rug |

### 4. Is this the right time?

Consider:
- Dependencies on other work
- Seasonal timing (don't ship during holiday if you need support)
- Strategic initiatives that might shift priorities
- Recent releases that need to stabilize

### 5. Are the right people available?

| Good Situation | Problem |
|----------------|---------|
| Designer + programmer available | Key people committed elsewhere |
| Team has relevant expertise | Would need to learn too much |
| Interested in the project | Burned out or disengaged |

## Making the Call

After discussing each pitch:

| Decision | Next Step |
|----------|-----------|
| **Bet** | Assign a team, post the kick-off message |
| **Don't bet** | Let it go—no tracking needed |
| **Maybe later** | Someone can track it privately and pitch again |

"Don't bet" isn't rejection—it's just "not now." The pitch might come back when timing is better or when it's been reshaped based on feedback.

## What Gets Bet

The outcome of the betting table is concrete commitments:
- **These projects** will happen
- **These teams** will work on them
- **This cycle** starts on this date

No maybes. No backlogs of "things to do later." Clean, clear commitments for the next six weeks.

## The Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It's Bad |
|---------|--------------|
| Betting on unshaped work | Pushing uncertainty to the team |
| Too many bets | Fragmenting focus |
| Betting to be nice | Wasting cycles on low-value work |
| Not betting because of fear | Paralysis, nothing gets done |
| Overriding the betting table mid-cycle | Destroying trust and focus |

## Post-Betting

After the betting table:
- Teams are notified of their projects
- Kick-off messages are posted
- The cycle begins
- No changes until the next betting table

The commitment is real. Interrupting cycles with new priorities destroys the whole system.
