# Project Modes for New Products

## When These Apply

These modes apply when you're building something **new**—a new product, a new major initiative, something that doesn't exist yet.

For existing products, normal Shape Up applies. For new products, you pass through three distinct phases.

## The Three Modes

### R&D Mode

**When:** You're figuring out what works. The architecture is unsettled. You're learning.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Team** | Senior people only who can navigate ambiguity |
| **Goal** | Spike, don't ship |
| **Shaping** | Impossible—you don't know enough yet |
| **Output** | Learning, not production code |

**What it looks like:**
- Trying different approaches
- Throwing things away
- Rapid prototyping
- Technical exploration

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't try to run normal Shape Up—you can't shape what you don't understand
- Don't expect to ship anything
- Don't add junior people who need clear direction

### Production Mode

**When:** The core architecture works. You know how to build. You're expanding.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Team** | Can expand with normal team composition |
| **Goal** | Ship to the codebase |
| **Shaping** | Normal shaping process |
| **Output** | Real features, real code |

**What it looks like:**
- Normal six-week cycles
- Shaped pitches and betting
- Features getting built and deployed
- Growing the team as needed

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't keep the R&D mindset of "we're just experimenting"
- Don't avoid committing to real deadlines

### Cleanup Mode

**When:** You're getting ready to launch to customers.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Team** | Everyone pitches in |
| **Goal** | Ship to customers |
| **Shaping** | Less formal—fix what's needed |
| **Output** | Polish, fixes, final touches |

**What it looks like:**
- Unstructured time
- Bug fixing
- Edge case handling
- Getting things "good enough"

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't try to add new features
- Don't go back to R&D exploration
- Don't extend indefinitely—set a launch date

## The Transitions

### R&D → Production

You're ready to transition when:
- Core architecture is settled
- You know how to build the main things
- Work can be shaped in advance
- Adding more people would help, not hinder

### Production → Cleanup

You're ready to transition when:
- Most features are built
- The list of "must fix before launch" is clear
- It's about polish, not new capabilities

## Examples

### Good R&D

"We spent 8 weeks with two senior engineers trying three different approaches to real-time sync. We threw away two of them. Now we know how it needs to work."

### Bad R&D

"We've been 'experimenting' for 6 months with a growing team and nothing to show for it."

### Good Production

"We shaped a 'user profiles' pitch and bet on it. The team shipped it in the cycle. Now we're betting on 'notifications' for the next cycle."

### Bad Production

"We're trying to shape work, but nobody knows if the architecture will support it. We keep running into fundamental problems."

## The Key Insight

Don't run normal Shape Up during R&D—it doesn't work. You can't shape what you don't understand yet.

Don't stay in R&D mode too long—at some point you need to commit to production.

Don't skip cleanup—launching something half-polished damages your reputation.

Each mode has its purpose. Knowing which mode you're in helps you apply the right practices.
