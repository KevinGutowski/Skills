# Team Ownership

## The Core Principle

Give teams the whole project and let them figure out how to execute it. Don't break work into tasks and assign them. Don't play the "architect" who splits work into pieces for others to execute.

**The alternative—assigning tasks—is like putting the pitch through a paper shredder.** Everybody gets disconnected pieces. We want the project to stay "whole" through the entire process so we never lose sight of the bigger picture.

## Why This Works

### For the Team
- Talented people don't like being treated like "code monkeys" or ticket takers
- Teams love having freedom to implement ideas the way they think is best
- They can apply their judgment and expertise to real trade-offs

### For the Project
- Nobody can predict at the beginning what exactly will need to be done
- What works on paper almost never works exactly as designed in practice
- The designers and programmers doing the real work are in the best position to make changes

### For Responsibility
- When you own a project, you own the outcome
- When you're assigned tasks, you execute your piece without feeling responsible for the whole
- Ownership leads to better decisions at every level

## What Teams Have

Teams aren't given absolute freedom to invent a solution from scratch. They have:

| From Shaping | What It Provides |
|--------------|------------------|
| The pitch | Clear direction and goals |
| The appetite | Time constraint |
| The boundaries | What's in and out of scope |
| De-risked concept | Known rabbit holes addressed |

With these guard rails in place, the team can fill in the outline with real design decisions and implementation.

## What Teams Do

1. **Define their own tasks** — They discover work through doing real work
2. **Choose their own approach** — They decide how to build it
3. **Make trade-offs** — They cut scope, simplify solutions, solve problems
4. **Integrate continuously** — They finish one slice at a time
5. **Own quality** — They test as they go, not at the end

## The Trust Equation

```
Shaped Work + Team Autonomy = Better Outcomes Than Prescribed Tasks
```

Shaping provides direction without dictating implementation. The team has room to be creative within the constraints. Their talent and knowledge of the particulars leads to a better finished product than we could have by determining the final form in advance.

## Planning Blinds You to Reality

When teams are assigned individual tasks:
- Each person can execute their piece without seeing the whole
- Planning up front makes you blind to reality along the way
- You miss chances to simplify, combine, or cut work

When teams own projects:
- They see every task in context
- They adapt to discoveries as they work
- They make smart trade-offs throughout

## Common Concerns

### "Won't they build the wrong thing?"

The pitch defines the problem and the general approach. The team builds *that*, not whatever they want.

### "How do we track progress?"

Use hill charts and scopes. The team shows progress at the scope level, not the task level.

### "What if they go in circles?"

The pitch gives direction. The appetite gives a deadline. The circuit breaker ensures we don't let projects run forever.

### "Don't we need to coordinate their work?"

The team coordinates themselves. They're working on one project together, talking daily, integrating continuously.

## The Alternative Is Worse

If you assign tasks:
- You become the bottleneck
- You make decisions without context
- You treat skilled people like interchangeable parts
- You kill motivation and ownership

Letting go of control feels scary. But the results—faster shipping, better outcomes, happier teams—are worth it.
