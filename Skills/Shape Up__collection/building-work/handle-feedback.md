# Handling Feedback After Ship

## Let the Storm Pass

After launching a new feature, feedback pours in. Customers react. Some love it. Some hate it. Some want changes.

**The instinct:** React immediately. Fix every complaint. Add every requested feature.

**The discipline:** Let the storm pass. Give it a few days. The feedback that sticks around is the feedback worth shaping.

### Why Wait?

| Immediate Feedback | Feedback That Sticks |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Emotional reactions | Real pain points |
| Adjustment period complaints | Genuine usability issues |
| "I want it the old way" | "This doesn't work for my use case" |
| High volume, low signal | Lower volume, high signal |

The first wave of feedback includes people who just don't like change. After a week, you'll see which complaints persist and which fade as people adjust.

## Stay Debt-Free

Keep the slate clean for the next cycle. Don't make promises. Don't accumulate a list of "quick fixes" that pile up.

**The temptation:** "It'll just take a day" or "We should fix that before moving on"

**The reality:**
- Those "quick fixes" multiply
- They steal time from the next shaped project
- They fragment the team's focus
- They create hidden tech debt

### How to Say No Gracefully

| What They Say | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| "Can you add X?" | "Thanks for the feedback. We're watching how people use this and may shape improvements for a future cycle." |
| "This is broken!" | "Let us look at that. If it's a bug we'll triage it. If it's a feature request, it'll go through our shaping process." |
| "When will you fix Y?" | "We don't make commitments to specific features. If it's important, it'll get shaped and bet on." |

## Feedback Needs to Be Shaped

New feature requests that come from post-launch feedback follow the same process as any other idea:

1. **Raw request comes in** — "Add dark mode"
2. **Someone tracks it** — Support or Product notes the request
3. **Pattern emerges** — Same request comes from multiple customers
4. **Shaping begins** — Product defines the problem, appetite, and solution
5. **Pitch is written** — The shaped work is presented
6. **Betting table decides** — It competes for a cycle like any other pitch

There's no fast lane for post-launch feedback. Everything goes through the process.

## The Cool-Down Buffer

The two-week cool-down between cycles provides a natural buffer for:
- Urgent bug fixes that truly can't wait
- Small polish items the team wants to address
- Exploratory work to understand feedback

But cool-down isn't for shipping new features. It's for maintaining the clean slate.

## When to Act Immediately

Some feedback demands immediate action:

| Act Now | Can Wait |
|---------|----------|
| Data loss bugs | Feature requests |
| Security issues | UX improvements |
| Service outages | Edge case bugs |
| Broken core functionality | Polish issues |

For everything else, the answer is: "Thanks for the feedback. We'll consider it for a future cycle."

## The Long View

A feature you shipped today might generate feedback for months. If you react to every piece of feedback:
- You never finish anything new
- You're constantly firefighting
- Quality suffers as you rush fixes
- The team burns out

If you filter feedback through shaping:
- Important patterns emerge
- Solutions get properly designed
- The team stays focused
- Each cycle delivers real value

The discipline of "let it wait" leads to better products than the chaos of "fix it now."
