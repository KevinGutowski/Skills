# Comparing to Baseline

## The "Is It Good Enough?" Question

When the end of the cycle approaches, there's always queasiness in the stomach. You look at your work and ask: Is it good enough? Is this ready to release?

Shipping on time means shipping something imperfect. There's always more work than time. How do we make the call?

## The Wrong Comparison: Up to Ideal

Designers and programmers always want to do their best work. It doesn't matter if the button is on the center of the landing page or two pages down a settings screen—the designer will give it their best attention.

Pride in the work is important for quality and morale. But if we aim for an ideal perfect design, we'll never get there.

**The trap:** Constantly comparing what we have to what we imagine it could be. There's always a more elegant solution, a smoother interaction, a cleaner implementation.

## The Right Comparison: Down to Baseline

Instead of comparing up to the ideal, compare down to **baseline**—the current reality for customers.

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| How do customers solve this problem today? | The pain we're eliminating |
| What's the frustrating workaround? | The value we're adding |
| How long should they wait while we debate? | The cost of delay |

## Example: The Calendar Feature

Customers want a calendar. The ideal calendar has:
- Drag-and-drop events
- Multi-day event spans
- Color coding
- Multiple views (day, week, month)
- Recurring events
- Integration with external calendars

That's a 6-month project.

**The baseline:** Customers are driving to the office to look at a chalkboard calendar. Or scrolling through an endless agenda list that doesn't show empty time slots.

**The shipped version:** A simple two-month grid with dots that shows when slots are free. No dragging, no multi-day spans.

Compared to ideal? Disappointing.
Compared to baseline? Massively better.

## The Mindset Shift

| Old Mindset | New Mindset |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Never good enough" | "Better than what they have now" |
| "What's missing?" | "What's improved?" |
| "We need more time" | "We need to ship" |
| Focus on gaps | Focus on value |

## Why This Works

1. **Motivates action** — Seeing progress against baseline feels good
2. **Enables decisions** — You can say "This isn't perfect, but it definitely works and customers will feel it's a big improvement"
3. **Reduces paralysis** — Stops endless debates about which design is marginally better
4. **Centers the customer** — It's less about us and more about value for them

## Applying It

When someone says "Wouldn't it be better if...":

1. **Acknowledge the improvement** — Yes, it probably would be better
2. **Check the baseline** — Is what we have now better than what customers have today?
3. **Consider the cost** — How much longer should customers wait for this improvement?
4. **Make the call** — If it's better than baseline, it might be good enough to ship

The goal isn't to ship bad work. The goal is to ship *real improvement* to customers instead of holding out for *perfect improvement* that never arrives.

## When to Push for More

Sometimes the answer to "Is it good enough?" is genuinely "No."

**Ship if:**
- The core use case works
- It's clearly better than the current alternative
- The remaining issues are edge cases

**Don't ship if:**
- The core use case is broken
- It's not actually better than the workaround
- The remaining issues affect most users

The baseline comparison helps make this judgment. If you can't honestly say "This is better than what they have now," then you have more work to do.
