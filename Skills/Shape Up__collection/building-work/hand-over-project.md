# Handing Over Projects

## Assign Projects, Not Tasks

We *don't* start by assigning tasks to anyone. Nobody plays the role of the "taskmaster" or the "architect" who splits the project up into pieces for other people to execute.

**Why not?** Splitting the project into tasks up front is like putting the pitch through a paper shredder. Everybody just gets disconnected pieces. We want the project to stay "whole" through the entire process so we never lose sight of the bigger picture.

Instead, we trust the team to take on the entire project and work within the boundaries of the pitch. The team is going to define their own tasks and their own approach to the work.

## Why Teams Love This

Teams love being given more freedom to implement an idea the way they think is best. Talented people don't like being treated like "code monkeys" or ticket takers.

Projects also turn out better when the team is given responsibility to look after the whole:
- Nobody can predict at the beginning what exactly will need to be done
- What works on paper almost never works exactly as designed in practice
- The designers and programmers doing the real work are in the best position to make changes

When teams are assigned individual tasks, each person can execute their piece without feeling responsible for how all the pieces fit together. Planning up front makes you blind to the reality along the way.

## The Kick-off

1. **Create the project space** — Add the team to it
2. **Post the shaped concept** — The pitch or a distilled version of it
3. **Have a brief call** — Let the team ask questions; don't pre-plan the work

The call gives the team a chance to ask any important questions that aren't clear from the write-up. Then, with a rough understanding of the project, they're ready to get started.

## Getting Oriented

Work in the first few days doesn't look like "work":
- No one is checking off tasks
- Nothing is getting deployed
- There aren't any deliverables to look at
- Often there isn't even much communication

**Why?** Because each person has their head down trying to figure out how the existing system works and which starting point is best. Everyone is busy learning the lay of the land.

### What Managers Should Do

**Respect this phase.** Teams can't just dive into a codebase and start building new functionality immediately. They have to:
- Acquaint themselves with the relevant code
- Think through the pitch
- Go down some short dead ends to find a starting point

**Don't ask for status too early.** Interfering takes away time the team needs to find the best approach. The exploration needs to happen anyway. Asking for visible progress will only push it underground.

**Empower honesty.** It's better for the team to explicitly say "I'm still figuring out how to start" so they don't have to hide or disguise this legitimate work.

**When to step in:** If the silence doesn't start to break after three days, that's a reasonable time to check in.

## Imagined vs Discovered Tasks

Since the team was given the project and not tasks, they need to come up with the tasks themselves.

| Imagined Tasks | Discovered Tasks |
|----------------|------------------|
| What we *think* we need to do at the start | What we *discover* we need to do from real work |
| Based on assumptions | Based on reality |
| Usually incomplete | The true bulk of the project |

### How Tasks Get Discovered

**Example 1:** The designer adds a new button on the desktop interface but notices there's no obvious place for it on mobile. New task: figure out how to reveal the button on mobile.

**Example 2:** The first pass of the design has good visual hierarchy, but the designer realizes there needs to be more explanatory copy in a place that disrupts the layout. Two new tasks: Change the layout to accommodate copy; write the copy.

**Example 3:** A programmer is working on a database migration. While looking at the model to understand associations, she runs into a method that needs to be updated for a different part of the project later. New task: update that method.

**The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start doing real work.** That doesn't mean the teams start by building just anything. They need to pick something meaningful to build first—something central to the project while still small enough to be done end-to-end in a few days.

## What the Team Has

Remember: we aren't giving the teams absolute freedom to invent a solution from scratch. We've done the shaping. We've set the boundaries.

The pitch is the assignment. With their talent and knowledge of the particulars, the team is going to arrive at a better finished product than we could have by trying to determine the final form in advance.
