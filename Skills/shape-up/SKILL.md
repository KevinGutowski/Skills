name: shape-up
description: Shape Up product development methodology from Basecamp. Use for shaping work (setting boundaries, finding elements, identifying risks, writing pitches), betting on work (evaluating pitches, making cycle decisions, handling bugs), and building work (handing over projects, integrating slices, mapping scopes, showing progress, cutting scope). Covers the full 6-week cycle workflow.

# Shape Up

Product development methodology from Basecamp built around fixed-time, variable-scope cycles.

## Core Principle

**Fixed time, variable scope.** Don't ask "How long will this take?" Ask "How much time is this worth?" The appetite constrains the solution, not the other way around.

## Phase Selection

| Phase | When to Use | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Shaping** | Before betting, when defining what to build | [shaping.md](references/shaping.md) |
| **Betting** | During cool-down, when deciding what to commit to next | [betting.md](references/betting.md) |
| **Building** | During the cycle, when executing on bet projects | [building.md](references/building.md) |

Read the appropriate phase reference based on user context.

## The Cycle Rhythm

```
6 weeks building → 2 weeks cool-down → 6 weeks building → ...
```

- **Shaping** happens continuously, producing pitches ready for the betting table
- **Betting** happens during cool-down, selecting what to build next
- **Building** happens during the 6-week cycle, with teams owning complete projects
