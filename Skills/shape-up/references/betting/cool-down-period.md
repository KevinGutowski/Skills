# The Cool-Down Period

## The Rhythm

```
6 weeks building → 2 weeks cool-down → 6 weeks building → ...
```

Between every six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for cool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where teams can breathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next.

## Why Cool-Down Matters

### For Teams

During cool-down, programmers and designers are free to work on whatever they want. They might:
- Fix bugs that have been bothering them
- Explore new ideas
- Try out new technical possibilities
- Learn new tools or techniques
- Recover from an intense cycle

This isn't a vacation—it's flexible time for work that doesn't fit neatly into a shaped project.

### For Stakeholders

The two weeks give management time to hold the betting table. Betting means:
- Looking at what we accomplished in the last cycle
- Reviewing shaped work that's ready
- Making decisions about what to do next

Decoupling betting from building keeps the actual build cycles uninterrupted.

## What Happens During Cool-Down

| Activity | Who | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Bug fixes | Teams | Clean up issues that accumulated |
| Exploration | Teams | Try ideas without commitment |
| Recovery | Teams | Recharge after focused work |
| Betting table | Stakeholders | Choose next cycle's projects |
| Shaping | Product | Prepare pitches for future cycles |
| One-on-ones | All | Cross-pollinate ideas between teams |

## The Math Adds Up

Two weeks every six weeks adds up to ~4 months per year of flexible time. That's substantial room for:
- Bug fixes
- Technical debt
- Exploration
- Learning
- Unexpected issues

Without cool-down, these things either don't happen or interrupt focused project work.

## Protecting the Cycle

The cool-down period protects the six-week build cycle from interruptions:

| Without Cool-Down | With Cool-Down |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Bugs interrupt project work | Bugs wait for cool-down |
| "Quick fixes" fragment focus | Quick fixes are batched |
| Exploration never happens | Built-in exploration time |
| No time to think ahead | Betting table has space |

When someone asks "Can we squeeze in X?" during a cycle, the answer is: "Let's look at that in cool-down."

## What Cool-Down Is NOT

- **Not a free-for-all** — Teams still do work, just not shaped project work
- **Not a vacation** — People are at work, but with more autonomy
- **Not wasted time** — Important maintenance happens here
- **Not optional** — It's a structural part of the method

## The Natural Rhythm

Cool-down creates a natural pause and reset. It's the exhale after the inhale of a focused cycle.

Without it:
- Work blurs together
- Burnout accumulates
- Small issues become big problems
- There's no time to step back and think

With it:
- Each cycle feels complete
- Teams arrive refreshed
- Issues get addressed before they compound
- Betting decisions have space

The rhythm of build-cooldown-build creates sustainable momentum instead of unsustainable rush.
