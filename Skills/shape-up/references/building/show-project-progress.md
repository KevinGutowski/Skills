# Showing Project Progress

## The Problem with Task Lists

Managers want to see status without asking. But to-do lists have problems that make them insufficient for judging status.

### Tasks That Aren't There

A list with a few completed items and no incomplete items left could mean:
- All the work is done, OR
- The team knows there's more work but hasn't defined tasks yet

In real life, to-do lists actually *grow* as the team makes progress. Issues are discovered by getting involved in the problem.

### Estimates Don't Show Uncertainty

Two tasks both estimated at 4 hours can mean very different things:
- One the team has done ten times → confident estimate
- One the team has never done before → could be 4 hours or 3 days

It's not meaningful to write "4 hours, or maybe 3 days" as an estimate.

## Work Is Like a Hill

We shift focus from what's done/not done to what's unknown/solved.

Every piece of work has two phases:

| Phase | Feels Like | What's Happening |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Uphill** | Uncertainty, unknowns | Figuring out what to do |
| **Top** | "Now I know what to do" | Approach is clear |
| **Downhill** | Certainty, confidence | Executing known work |

### Example: Hosting a Dinner Party

**Bottom of hill:** You've set the date but haven't thought about what to cook. No idea about cuisine or dish.

**Halfway up:** You've decided on Indian cuisine but haven't chosen a specific dish yet. "What percent complete is the project?" doesn't even make sense.

**Top of the hill:** You've chosen a recipe and made a shopping list. You can see all the steps left. You could even estimate how long it'll take.

**Downhill:** Buy ingredients, prep, cook. Each step moves you closer to done.

## Scopes on the Hill

Combine the hill with scopes. The scopes give language ("Locate," "Reply") and the hill describes status ("uphill," "downhill").

Plot each scope as a different dot on the hill to see the whole project:

```
          ·Figuring it out·    ·Executing·
         /                  \
        /    [Email]         \
       /                      \  [Delivery]
      /                        \
[Menu]                          \  [Global]
─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

A dot that doesn't move is a raised hand: "Something might be wrong here."

## The Power of Second-Order View

Comparing past states shows not just where work stands but how it's *moving*.

With this view, managers can:
- Judge what's in motion and what's stuck
- See which problems the team chose to solve
- Jump directly into conversation about specific scopes

"Looks like 'Autosave' has been uphill for a while. What's the unknown holding it back?"

## Nobody Says "I Don't Know"

Nobody wants to raise their hand and say "I don't know how to solve this problem." This causes teams to hide uncertainty and accumulate risk.

The hill chart allows everybody to see that somebody might be stuck without them actually saying it. The language of uphill/downhill makes it about the *work*, not the person.

**Question:** What can we solve to get that over the hill?

## When a Scope Won't Move

Sometimes a stuck scope reveals the lines were drawn wrong.

**Example:** "Notify" was stuck for six days. When we checked in:
- The work was moving fine
- The problem was that "Notify" wasn't a single thing
- It had three parts: email design, email delivery, in-app display
- Some parts were over the hill, some weren't

**Solution:** Break the scope apart into smaller scopes that can move independently:
- Hey Menu Notification (far left—just starting)
- Email Notification (near top—almost figured out)
- Notification Delivery (far right—nearly done)

## Build Your Way Uphill

Some teams struggle with backsliding. They move a scope to the top, then slide it back when they uncover an unexpected unknown.

This happens when someone did the uphill work with their head instead of their hands.

| Third of the Hill | What It Means |
|-------------------|---------------|
| First third up | "I've thought about this" |
| Second third up | "I've validated my approach" |
| Final third (top) | "I've built enough that I don't believe there are other unknowns" |

## Solve in the Right Sequence

Some scopes are riskier than others. Push the scariest work uphill first.

**Example:** Two scopes—geocoding (never done before) and email template (familiar work). If you're out of time at the end, which could you whip together?

The email could be worked out in a day. The geocoder might present problems that take weeks. Don't let that surprise come at the end.

**Journalists use the "inverted pyramid":** Start with the most essential information, then add details in decreasing order of importance.

Effective teams sequence the same way:
1. Most important problems with most unknowns first
2. Get them over the hill
3. Leave routine work for last

As the cycle ends, you should have finished the important things and left "nice to haves" lingering.
