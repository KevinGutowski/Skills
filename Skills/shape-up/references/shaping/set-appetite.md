# Setting the Appetite

## Why Appetite Matters

Sometimes an idea gets us excited right away. In that case we need to temper the excitement by checking whether this is really something we're going to be able to invest time in. If we don't stop to think about how valuable the idea is, we can all jump too quickly to either committing resources or having long discussions about potential solutions that go nowhere.

Other ideas are less exciting and feel more like a challenge we didn't ask for. The customer wants a calendar; we don't particularly want to build one, but we do feel we need to do something about the request.

Whether we're chomping at the bit or reluctant to dive in, it helps to explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject deserves.

## Two Sizes of Appetite

| Size | Time | Team | Use When |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Small Batch** | 1-2 weeks | 1 designer + 1-2 programmers | Quick wins, focused fixes |
| **Big Batch** | 6 weeks | 1 designer + 1-2 programmers | Major features, significant changes |

In rare cases where the scope is so big that a six-week project isn't conceivable, we'll try to hammer it down by narrowing the problem definition. If we still can't shrink the scope, we'll break off a meaningful part of the project that we can shape to a six-week appetite.

## Responding to Raw Ideas

Our default response to any idea that comes up should be: "Interesting. Maybe some day." A very soft "no" that leaves all our options open. We don't put it in a backlog. We give it space so we can learn whether it's really important and what it might entail.

It's too early to say "yes" or "no" on first contact. Even if we're excited about it, we shouldn't make a commitment that we don't yet understand.

**Keep a poker face.** We don't want to shut down an idea we don't understand, but showing too much enthusiasm right away can set expectations that this thing is going to happen.

## Narrowing the Problem

### Example: The Permissions Request

A customer asked for more complex permission rules. It could easily have taken six weeks to build the change she wanted. Instead of taking the request at face value, we dug deeper.

It turned out that someone had archived a file without knowing the file would disappear for everyone else using the system. Instead of creating a rule to prevent some people from archiving, we realized we could put a warning on the archive action itself that explains the impact.

**Result:** A one-day change instead of a six-week project.

### Example: The Calendar Request

"Add a calendar" sounds clear, but what does it really mean?

We called a customer who asked for this feature. Instead of asking her why she wants a calendar and what it should look like, we asked her *when* she wanted a calendar. What was she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?

She told us she worked in an office with a big calendar drawn on a chalkboard wall. One day she was working from home. A client called and asked to schedule a meeting. She had to drive to the office to look at the wall calendar. Traffic was terrible, and in the end there wasn't a free space that worked.

The insight wasn't "computerize the calendar"—that's obvious. What we learned was that "see free spaces" was the important thing for this use case, not "do everything a calendar does."

This led to the Dot Grid concept: a two-month read-only grid that shows dots on days with events. Simple, focused, shippable in six weeks.

## The Questions to Ask

| Instead of | Ask |
|------------|-----|
| "What should we build?" | "What's really going wrong?" |
| "How long will it take?" | "How much time is this worth?" |
| "What do users want?" | "When did the thought occur to ask for it?" |

## When You Can't Figure It Out

If it's not critical now and we can't get our hands around the problem, we walk away and work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will give us better insight.

The appetite tells us how much research is worthwhile. A six-week problem deserves more digging than a two-week problem.
